AngularJS-Color-Picker
======================
A simple port of Lakshan Perera's "Really Simple Color Picker" into an AngularJS directive. I thought I would throw this up in case anyone else would like this feature. Shout out to <strong>Brandon Tilley</strong> for help with the scoping.

<strong>Usage</strong><br />
In this use I have create a new attribute called <i>colorPicker="myModel"</i>. Simply add this to an input tag and set the value to what ever model you wish to control and voila, your hex color is now data-binded.
